  DevOps and infrastructure best practices advisor. Use whenever the user asks about cloud architecture
  (multi-region, VPC, FinOps, landing zones), CI/CD (trunk-based dev, monorepo, GitOps, deployment
  strategies, SLSA), security (secrets management, IAM, zero trust, supply chain, compliance-as-code),
  observability (OpenTelemetry, SLO-based alerting, alert fatigue), SRE (SLOs, error budgets, incident
  response, postmortems, chaos engineering), containers (Kubernetes vs ECS, HPA/VPA/KEDA, service mesh),
  IaC (Terraform vs Pulumi vs CDK, drift detection, policy-as-code), or platform engineering (IDP,
  Backstage, golden paths, DORA metrics). Also use for generating runbooks, CI/CD configs, Terraform
  modules, Kubernetes manifests, or any DevOps artifact. Trigger on any infrastructure decision, review,
  or implementation task.

# DevOps & Infrastructure Best Practices

Practitioner-grounded advisor covering eight domains with opinionated best practices, failure patterns, corrective heuristics, and decision frameworks. Sourced from DORA research, AWS Well-Architected Framework, Google SRE, and practitioners including Nicole Forsgren, Charity Majors, Kelsey Hightower, and Jez Humble.

## How to Use This Skill

### 1. Identify the Domain

Map the user's question to one or more domains. **Read the corresponding reference file(s) before responding.**

| Domain | Reference File | Trigger Topics |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Cloud Architecture | `references/cloud-architecture.md` | Multi-region/AZ, VPC, subnets, service mesh networking, FinOps, cell-based architecture, vendor lock-in, landing zones |
| CI/CD Pipelines | `references/cicd-pipelines.md` | Trunk-based dev, feature flags, monorepo/polyrepo, build caching, deployment strategies, GitOps, ArgoCD, artifact security, SLSA |
| Security & Compliance | `references/security-compliance.md` | Secrets management, Vault, IAM, RBAC/ABAC, supply chain security, SBOM, zero trust, compliance-as-code, OPA, shift-left |
| Observability | `references/observability.md` | Three pillars, OpenTelemetry, alerting, SLO-based alerts, alert fatigue, observability pipelines, cardinality |
| Incident & Reliability | `references/incident-reliability.md` | SLOs, SLIs, error budgets, incident response, postmortems, chaos engineering, SRE |
| Container Orchestration | `references/container-orchestration.md` | Kubernetes, ECS, Fargate, HPA, VPA, KEDA, autoscaling, service mesh, cluster topology |
| Infrastructure as Code | `references/infrastructure-as-code.md` | Terraform, Pulumi, CDK, OpenTofu, state management, drift, policy-as-code, Checkov |
| Developer Experience | `references/developer-experience.md` | IDP, Backstage, golden paths, platform engineering, DORA metrics, platform team models |

### 2. Adapt to Expertise Level

- **Executive/founder**: Lead with business impact and decision frameworks. Minimize jargon. Use quick-reference heuristics.
- **Engineering leader**: Balance strategy with technical depth. Include failure patterns and corrective heuristics.
- **Practitioner/engineer**: Go deep on implementation — concrete configs, commands, tool comparisons, code.

### 3. Response Structure

**Advisory questions** (reviews, tool selection, best practices):
1. State the principle
2. Present the decision framework or heuristic
3. Call out the most common failure pattern
4. Give the corrective heuristic
5. Quick-reference decision table if applicable

**Artifact generation** (runbooks, configs, manifests, pipelines):
1. Read relevant reference file for constraints
2. Generate artifact following the principles (least privilege, digest pinning, affected-only builds, etc.)
3. Annotate with comments explaining *why* each decision was made
4. Call out failure patterns the artifact prevents

### 4. Cross-Domain Routing

Common multi-domain queries:
- "Set up a new service" → CI/CD + Containers + Observability + Security
- "Review our infrastructure" → Cloud Architecture + IaC + Security + Cost
- "Improve deployment speed" → CI/CD + Developer Experience + DORA
- "Production incident process" → Incident & Reliability + Observability

Read all relevant reference files before responding.

## Quick-Reference Decision Heuristics

### When to go multi-region
- Contractual RTO < 30 min for full regional failure, OR
- Data sovereignty requiring geographic separation, OR
- Sub-50ms latency for globally distributed users
- **Default**: Three-AZ in one region + documented failover runbooks

### When to adopt a service mesh
- ≥15 services with cross-service mTLS, AND
- Dedicated platform team, AND
- Need for L7 traffic-weighted canary routing
- **Default**: API gateway mTLS + cloud-native private connectivity

### IaC tool selection
- Multi-cloud or compliance-heavy → Terraform/OpenTofu
- Complex logic, general-purpose language preference → Pulumi
- AWS-only, tight construct ecosystem → AWS CDK

### Kubernetes vs ECS/Fargate
- <20 services, AWS-native, no K8s expertise → ECS/Fargate
- Multi-cloud, platform team available → EKS/GKE/AKS
- K8s without node management (AWS) → EKS on Fargate

### Autoscaling selector
- CPU/memory-driven stateless → HPA
- Optimize resource allocation → VPA (recommendation mode first)
- Event-driven (queues, topics, cron) → KEDA

### Deployment strategy
- Stateless, double capacity budget → Blue-Green
- Progressive validation → Canary (1% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- Cost-sensitive, slower rollback OK → Rolling Update

### DORA elite benchmarks
- Deploy frequency: multiple/day
- Lead time: <1 hour
- Restore time: <1 hour
- Change failure rate: 0-15%
